# DotClean

DotClean will remove the ._ (dot underscore) files on macOS using a drag and drop interface.

This is useful for people who are not comfortable using the command line.

These ._ files can cause issues in certain applications, such as when they are present on an SD card for a YX5300 UART Control Serial MP3 Music Player.
